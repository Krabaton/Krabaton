### Hi there 👋

I have been working in web development since 2015, during which I've worked across various environments from outsourcing companies to startups. I'm a self-motivated professional who enjoys solving complex technical challenges.

I'm particularly focused on full-stack development using JavaScript across the entire technology stack, enabling seamless integration between frontend and backend. I stay current with emerging technologies and development methodologies.

I combine UX design principles with technical expertise to build scalable digital solutions. My technology stack includes:

**Frontend:** ⚡ TypeScript, ⚛️ React.js, 🔄 Redux, 🎨 SASS  
**Backend:** 🟢 Node.js, 🐍 Python, 🚀 Express.js, 🦉 Nest.js, ⚡ FastAPI, 🗡️ Django  
**Databases:** 🐬 MySQL, 🐘 PostgreSQL, 🍃 MongoDB  
**DevOps:** 🐳 Docker, ☁️ AWS, ☁️ Azure

As a full-stack developer, I bring comprehensive knowledge across all software development domains, capable of taking concepts from ideation through to production deployment.
